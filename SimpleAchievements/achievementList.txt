Welcome To Sky Factory 2!|A Modpack By Bacon_Donut|=======================::1
Hello and welcome to Sky Factory 2, a modded Sky Block mod pack! An infinite world of possibility awaits you...after you build it, of course, because you'll be starting in a void world with nothing between you and death but a single tree on one piece of dirt. But don't panic! The mods in this pack will allow you to get all the resources you need to build yourself an amazing world! Read on for more info about how to play this pack, who put it together, and for a list of goals for you to accomplish!::1
 |How To Use This Book|===================::1
Use the arrows at the bottom left and bottom right of this book to navigate between pages. You will see challenges broken into ages that represent the general path of progression, although you do not need to do them in order. Simply check the box next to each challenge as you complete them. Careful though! They get harder as you go along! Also, don't forget to craft yourself an Achievement Stand to store this book in!| | | |::1
A Note About Biomes|==============::1
The challenges in this book will help you through the early game, but there are several commonly asked question regarding biome behavior in Sky Factory.::1
Barrels fill with water just fine when it snows so there is nothing wrong with spawning in a snow biome such as Taiga. It does not rain in desert so barrels will not fill with water, but that is still a fine place to spawn because Water Buckets are craftable. Look it up in NEI to see how.::1
Oceans will spawn monsters but will not spawn passive animals, and Mushroom biomes spawn only Mooshrooms and no monsters.::1
Because of that, Ocean and Mooshroom are both viable places to spawn in, it will just add to the challenge and force you to travel if you want to complete all the challenges.| |Also, if you're the kind of person who likes to train dragons, remember that what biome you hatch your dragon in will determine what kind of dragon it grows up to be!::1

The Challenges|=============| |You can't ever "beat" the pack, but I've provided a list of challenges designed to help you progress, and give direction to your play.

You'll learn at lot and have some fun too!| |They are divided into ages that roughly match up to game progression, but you do NOT have to do them in order!| | |::1
